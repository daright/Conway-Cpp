Conway's Game of Life

The subject of the project was to create a Conyway's game of lie with its seven variants. The game is played on a board divided into squares cells. The board adjusts to the screen resolution. each cell has eight "neighbors", ie the cells adjacent to the sides and corners. Each cell can be in one of two states: it can be "living" (enabled) or "dead" (disabled). Cells change in successive units of time. The status of all the cells in a unit of time is used to calculate the state of all cells in the the next unit operation. After calculating all the cells change their state at exactly the same time. State of the cell depends only on the number of living neighbors. To start the game user must provide some inistial settings, after that there is no way to alter the game.
